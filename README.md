# üöÄ Buzzvel FE - Test 2025

This project was developed as part of a technical assessment for Buzzvel.  
I truly enjoyed working on it! As a front-end developer with experience in **React**, **Next.js**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, I felt very comfortable bringing the interface to life.

To style the project, I chose to use **Tailwind CSS** because I find it modern and practical. However, I also have experience with **Styled-Components**.

I hope you enjoy the result as much as I enjoyed building it!
